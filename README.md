# Mid Term Project

In this project, I was asked to think of a topic and problem, collect experimental data, complete an end-to-end analysis and present the results, all by yourself

The Instruction is: First, choose a topic of interest to you and understand what research has already been done in that area. What are some interesting questions that remain? Can you turn those questions into a product (i.e. can you extract value out of answering those questions)?

# TOPIC OF THIS PROJECT: Instagram Engagement Analysis For Nomad Connects

# Overview of Nomads Connect Community: 
Founded by Michelle Smit, born from her travel and work challenges, including visa issues. Nomad Connects is a global hub for digital nomads, fostering community, knowledge-sharing, and support in the world of remote work and travel.


# Introduction:

Instagram is the most important tool for Nomad connect to get Publicity and let the network grow. Followers are important, but even more important is the number of likes, comments and shares per post.
 
# Shares:	
-	Shares increase your contents reach and potentially attracting new followers. It says people are really involved by the topic. 
•	Increase content reach.
•	Attracting potentially new followers
•	People are involved.

# Comments:
-	comments are also great; Indicate active engagement and the level of interest your content generates.  

# Likes:
-	Likes are the least, but still important outcome of a post content. Higher is indicating that you contact is resonating with your audience. It also signifies approval and appreciation for your content.

# Methodology:

By looking at,
•	Likes
•	Comments
•	Shares
We found out, just after starting (and this well-known), that pictures do not attract people anymore on Instagram, so nearly all the post on Nomads connects are Reels. Also, in the future Nomad connects will post 99% Reels. In my data set I excluded post of pictures and video’s 
We want to find out which kind of Reels get to most attraction. Therefore, I divided the post content is groups. 
1)	Giveaway
2)	Giveaway- Winner announcement
3)	Join
4)	Meme
5)	Tips

# Main question: 
Which kind of post content gives the best results based on input and results? 
Memes and Give-aways scores best

Also handed out a questionnaire to the company owner how much work is put in for each post content. Input/investment.

# THANK YOU :)
